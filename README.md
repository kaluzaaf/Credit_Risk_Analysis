# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of the analysis is to use several different Machine Learning modules to help assess the credit risk of a data set of Lending Club's customers. This will allow Lending Club to make more informed decisions about who to extend loans to and who is a bad credit risk. This should lower Lending Clubâ€™s default rate and increase their profitability. 

We accomplish this task by employing the following strategies:
- Naive Random Sampling
- SMOTE Oversampling
- Under sampling
- Combined Over and Under Sampling
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier
- Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

I use these models to assess their balanced accuracy, precision, and recall scores. The balanced accuracy score is an averaged recall score taken from each class. The precision is a measure of the model's ability to identify only relevant data points and the recall score is a measure of the model's ability to find a certain percentage of bad borrowers. 

## Results:

## Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
